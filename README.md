MayLoon is a developer tool which assists Android developer to migrate their Android application to HTML5 platforms quicker.


It contains two parts:
  1. mayloon-porting-tool, which is distributed as an Eclipse plugin and serves as the interface for the developers.
  2. mayloon-runtime, which basically simulates many Android framework capabilities on top of HTML5 platforms and needs to
  be loaded with the converted Android app before launching.
  
Please checkout the wiki pages for user guide and the design rationles about how we make the conversion possible.

Please submit your bug reports via the GitHub issues.

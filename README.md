MayLoon is a developer tool which assists Android developer to migrate their Android application to HTML5 platforms quicker.


It contains two parts:
  1. mayloon-porting-tool, which is distributed as an Eclipse plugin and serves as the interface for the developers.
  2. mayloon-runtime, which basically simulates many Android framework capabilities on top of HTML5 platforms and needs to
  be loaded with the converted Android app before launching.
  
Please checkout the <a href="https://github.com/01org/mayloon-runtime/wiki">wiki</a> pages for user guide and the design rationles about how we make the conversion possible.

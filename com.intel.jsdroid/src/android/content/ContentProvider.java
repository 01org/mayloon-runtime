/**
 * Content providers are one of the primary building blocks of Android applications, providing
 * content to applications. They encapsulate data and provide it to applications through the single
 * {@link ContentResolver} interface. A content provider is only required if you need to share
 * data between multiple applications. For example, the contacts data is used by multiple
 * applications and must be stored in a content provider. If you don't need to share data amongst
 * multiple applications you can use a database directly via
 * {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase}.
 *
 * <p>When a request is made via
 * a {@link ContentResolver} the system inspects the authority of the given URI and passes the
 * request to the content provider registered with the authority. The content provider can interpret
 * the rest of the URI however it wants. The {@link UriMatcher} class is helpful for parsing
 * URIs.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary methods that need to be implemented are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #onCreate} which is called to initialize the provider</li>
 *   <li>{@link #query} which returns data to the caller</li>
 *   <li>{@link #insert} which inserts new data into the content provider</li>
 *   <li>{@link #update} which updates existing data in the content provider</li>
 *   <li>{@link #delete} which deletes data from the content provider</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getType} which returns the MIME type of data in the content provider</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p class="caution">Data access methods (such as {@link #insert} and
 * {@link #update}) may be called from many threads at once, and must be thread-safe.
 * Other methods (such as {@link #onCreate}) are only called from the application
 * main thread, and must avoid performing lengthy operations.  See the method
 * descriptions for their expected thread behavior.</p>
 *
 * <p>Requests to {@link ContentResolver} are automatically forwarded to the appropriate
 * ContentProvider instance, so subclasses don't have to worry about the details of
 * cross-process calls.</p>
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For more information about using content providers, read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">Content Providers</a>
